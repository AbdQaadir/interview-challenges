# Database challenge

## Task

We would like you to implement a couple of queries to a SQL database.

In the `src` folder there are two files `queries.js` and `queries.test.js`

You should read and edit `queries.js` with your solutions.

## Setup

You need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Then run `npm install`

And then you have two options:

### Option 1: Docker

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and run `docker-compose up`
to start a database

### Option 2: Native Database

You could install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) directly.
Follow the setup instructions on that page and make sure you create a database
with the following details:

```
Database name: kairos_database_challenge
User: postgres
Password: postgres
```

## Running your queries
